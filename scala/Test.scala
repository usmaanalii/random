/**
 * Case classes
 *      - Good for modeling immutable data
 *      - Useful in pattern matching
 *      - Doesn't need the *new* keyword in construction since case classes
 *        have an *apply* method by default, which takes care of construction
 *      - Parameters are public vals (vars are discouraged since they are
 *        designed primarily for immutable data)
 *      - Compared by structure and not by value, so two different objects
 *        with the same values would be considered equal
 */

/**
 * Pattern Matching
 *      - Used to check a value against a pattern
 *      - Can destructure successfull matches
 *      - Match expressions take
 *             1. Value
 *             2. *match* keyword
 *             3. At least one *case* value
 *      - Case classes are useful for pattern matching
 *      - Read 'Matching on case classes' from
 *        https://docs.scala-lang.org/tour/pattern-matching.html
 *      - Pattern guards (boolean expressions) can be used to make cases more
 *        specific, just add *if <boolean expression>*
