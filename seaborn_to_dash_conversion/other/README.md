## Notes

Hello, just thought I'd pop a few notes down to let you know why I've done certain things, and what questions I might have

- The regression line doesn't seem to match the seaborn chart, I'll look into this further, but do you have any ideas?
- I've hard coded the values in at the moment, just to get a rough prototype out, I'll make sure that the app is dynamic by Friday, since I'm aware it needs to be adaptable to different data sources
- I removed the hover data for the regression line, since I felt it cluttered the display a little

### TODO

- Make the legend color match the regression line color, not the opaque version
- Change the style of the scatter plot points to have a darker edge in order to match the seaborn plot
- Make the data dynamic based on the CSV file
- Reduce repetitive code
