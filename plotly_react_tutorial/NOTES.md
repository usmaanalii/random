## Chapter 2: Your first App

### First Steps

- Use `create-react-app`, which has all the necessary build tools and transpilation steps required already built in.
- This includes a simple server, so running `npm start` from within the app directory will open the app at `localhost:3000`

### Modules

- Used to keep your components separate
- Helps with application structure
- Used `import component from file*` syntax allowing you to pull in components as you please

### Node Modules

- Used to install modules via `npm install moduleName`
- Allows us to use Reat and build our app, without having to attach anything globally
